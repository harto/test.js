test.js - an xUnit-style unit testing framework for JavaScript

test.js offers the following advantages over existing JavaScript unit-testing
frameworks:

 * It has no dependencies beyond the core language. Unit tests may be run from
   within or without a web browser, from a command-line utility, or as part of
   a continuous integration process. (Note: only a Rhino-based test runner
   exists at this stage.)

 * It provides a familiar, simple, xUnit-style API to programmers.

See examples/ for common use cases.

(TODO: document assertions)

Launching the Rhino-based test runner:

   $ bin/test.js <my-test-scripts>

   Note: this distribution includes Rhino .jars, but you may utilise different/
   newer versions as required.

Running self-testing unit tests:

   $ bin/self-test
